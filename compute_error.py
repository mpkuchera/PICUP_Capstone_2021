    """
    Computes the percent error of our fit against Hubble's 
    original computed contstant of H0 = 500 km/s/Mpc and today's c
    onstant of 70 km/s/Mpc.
    

    Parameters
    ----------
    H0_fit: FLOAT
        value of Hubble's constant derived from our data in km/s/Mpc


    Returns
    -------
    error_original: FLOAT
       percent error with Hubble's original constant as the "true" value
    error_current: FLOAT
       percent error with today's Hubble constant as the "true" value
